# YouTube-Data-Analysis-and-Insights
In this project, I embarked on an exciting journey through my own YouTube data, exploring my browsing history, extracting valuable insights, and leveraging the power of machine learning provided a deeper understanding of my interests and preferences The work manifested itself in several key ways:
- **Data Retrieval**: I started by leveraging Google Takeout to retrieve a dataset of my YouTube history. This dataset contains a wealth of information about the videos I've watched, including titles, URLs, timestamps, and so much more. However, this initial dataset lacked details about the videos themselves, such as tags, duration, and other key attributes. To fill this gap I used the the Google API which I configured through the Google Cloud Console <i>https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/</i>. More informations about how to use the api to get youtube videos can be found here : <i>https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started?hl=fr</i>.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The raw data required careful preprocessing to ensure its quality and usability. I cleaned, formatted, and organized the data to create a solid foundation for coming analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: With the data prepared, I embarked on an exploratory journey. I visualized patterns, trends, and correlations within my viewing history. This phase revealed intriguing insights into the types of content I engage with the most, my viewing habits, and even the times when I'm most active on the platform.
- **Use of a ML pretrained model**: In cases where the topic information was absent from the data obtained via the YouTube API, I turned to the pretrained machine learning model, BERTopic, to predict the topics of these videos. This prediction was based on the content of their titles and tags.
- **Insight Generation**: With the model's predictions in hand, I generated insightful conclusions. I uncovered trends in my video preferences, and pinpointed the days when I'm most likely to indulge in YouTube.

- **Visualization**: I brought my insights to life through captivating visualizations. These visual representations made it easier to grasp the nuances in my YouTube consumption patterns. Thanks to *plotly.express* :).

**Note**: The data used here pertains only to August and September 2023, as evident in the provided code. For your personal use, you have the flexibility to work with your entire dataset, starting from the moment you first began watching videos on YouTube.
